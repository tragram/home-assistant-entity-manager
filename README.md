[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Skjall/home-assistant-entity-manager.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

A Home Assistant Add-on for standardizing and managing entity names according to a consistent, logical naming convention with an integrated Web UI.

## Features

- **Batch Entity Renaming**: Rename multiple entities according to a standardized pattern
- **Logical Naming Convention**: Follows the pattern `{area}.{device_type}.{location/name}`
- **Character Normalization**: Automatically normalizes special characters for entity IDs
- **Dependency Tracking**: Finds and updates entity references in automations, scenes, scripts and dashboards
- **Device Swap**: Replace a physical device with a new one — re-maps all references, carries over IDs/friendly names, and is crash-safe/resumable
- **Integration Bridge**: Native rename/removal for Zigbee2MQTT (via MQTT), Matter and ZHA — keeps Z2M friendly names in sync and prevents re-population after deletion
- **Z2M Name Drift**: Highlights devices whose Zigbee2MQTT name differs from the HA name and lets you sync them
- **Learn Translations**: Save a suffix translation to the mapping list directly from the entity editor
- **Label Management**: Track entity quality and processing status
- **Web Interface**: Visualize and manage entities through an intuitive UI
- **Safe Operations**: Preview and comprehensive validation before changes

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.7.2 or newer
- Python 3.12 or 3.13

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSkjall%2Fhome-assistant-entity-manager)

<details>
<summary>Manual Add-on installation</summary>

1. Navigate to Supervisor → Add-on Store
2. Click the three dots menu → Repositories
3. Add this repository: `https://github.com/Skjall/home-assistant-entity-manager`
4. Click "Add"
5. Find "Entity Manager" in the add-on store
6. Click on it and then click "Install"
7. Start the add-on
8. Click "OPEN WEB UI" to access the interface
</details>


## Usage

After installing and starting the Add-on:

1. Navigate to the sidebar in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Entity Manager"
3. Select an area from the dropdown
4. Optionally filter by domain (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
5. Preview entities that need renaming
6. Review dependency warnings (shows which automations/scenes use each entity)
7. Select entities to process
8. Click "Execute Changes" to apply

The web interface features:
- **Area-based navigation**: Browse entities organized by area
- **Domain filtering**: Filter entities by type (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
- **Visual indicators**: See which entities need renaming at a glance
- **Dependency detection**: See which automations and scenes use each entity
- **Safe preview**: Review all changes before applying them
- **Device management**: Rename devices directly from the interface
- **Custom overrides**: Set custom names for specific entities

## Naming Convention

Entities follow this pattern:
```
{area}.{device_type}.{location/name}
```

Examples:
- `office.light.ceiling` - Office ceiling light
- `living_room.sensor.temperature` - Living room temperature sensor
- `kitchen.switch.outlet_1` - Kitchen power outlet switch 1

### Naming templates

The Settings page provides two presets `Entity Manager` and `Home Assistant` and fully custom templates for
device names, entity registry names, and entity IDs. The Entity Manager preset remains the default, so upgrading does
not propose a different naming scheme unless you choose one.

Templates can use the following Home Assistant context:

`{floor}`, `{floor_id}`, `{area}`, `{area_id}`, `{device}`, `{device_id}`, `{entity}`, `{entity_id}`, `{domain}`,
`{device_class}`, `{manufacturer}`, `{model}`, and `{integration}`.

The entity-ID template is normalized with the same Home Assistant-compatible slug rules used elsewhere by the add-on;
the entity domain is added automatically. Open Settings to preview a template with sample data before saving it.

## Configuration

### Naming Overrides

Create a `naming_overrides.json` file to customize naming:

```json
{
  "areas": {
    "area_id_here": {
      "name": "Custom Area Name"
    }
  },
  "devices": {
    "device_id_here": {
      "name": "Custom Device Name"
    }
  },
  "entities": {
    "entity_registry_id_here": {
      "name": "Custom Entity Name"
    }
  }
}
```

### Rename Audit Log

Every successful entity rename is appended to `/data/rename_log.jsonl` (old →
new entity_id, friendly name, timestamp). This lets an external consumer find
out where a vanished entity went instead of only seeing that it disappeared.

Look it up via the API:

```
GET /api/rename_log?entity_id=light.kitchen_old
```

```json
{
  "query": "light.kitchen_old",
  "found": true,
  "renamed": true,
  "current_entity_id": "light.kitchen_ceiling",
  "history": [
    { "timestamp": "…", "old_entity_id": "light.kitchen_old",
      "new_entity_id": "light.kitchen_ceiling", "friendly_name": "Kitchen Ceiling" }
  ]
}
```

The lookup follows multi-hop rename chains (`a → b → c`) and returns
`"found": false` when the id was never renamed.

#### Direct access and API tokens

By default the web UI and API are reachable **only through Home Assistant
Ingress** (i.e. only for logged-in HA users); the add-on's port is not exposed.

To let an **external** tool use the API:

1. Open the add-on's web UI → **Settings → External API access** and click
   **Generate token**. The token is shown **once** — copy it now. Only a hash of
   it is stored; it cannot be retrieved again (regenerate to get a new one).
2. Map the add-on's port (Configuration → Network) to a host port.

Set `DIRECT_ACCESS_MODE=token` when publishing the port. With a token generated:

- **Ingress** traffic (the web UI) keeps working unchanged, no token needed.
- **Direct** (non-Ingress) API requests require the matching bearer token.
- Token generation and revocation stay Ingress-only.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer em_…" \
  "http://<ha-host>:<mapped-port>/api/rename_log?entity_id=light.kitchen_old"
```

Direct API access is disabled by default. Generating a new token or revoking it
immediately invalidates the previous one. `DIRECT_ACCESS_MODE=trusted` removes
API authentication and is intended only for a private development LAN.

In the add-on configuration this is the **Direct access mode** option:
`disabled` (default), `token`, or `trusted`. Never expose a `trusted` port beyond
a private development network.

## Safety Features

1. **Dry Run Mode**: Always test with `--test` flag first
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Automatically finds and updates entity references
3. **Label System**: Track which entities have been processed
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive checks before applying changes
5. **WebSocket & REST API**: Reliable communication with Home Assistant

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Add-on won't start
If the Add-on fails to start:
1. Check the Add-on logs for error messages
2. Ensure Home Assistant 2025.7.2 or newer is installed
3. Verify the Add-on has the necessary permissions

#### Web UI not accessible
If you can't access the web interface:
1. Ensure the Add-on is running
2. Try restarting the Add-on
3. Check if Ingress is enabled in the Add-on configuration

#### Entity rename fails
If entity renaming fails:
1. Check the entity ID is valid
2. Ensure the entity is not locked or read-only
3. Check if the new entity ID already exists
4. Review Add-on logs for specific error messages

### Debug Logging

Check the Add-on logs in Supervisor → Entity Manager → Logs

## Development

### Building the Add-on Locally

```bash
# Build for your architecture
docker build --build-arg BUILD_FROM="ghcr.io/home-assistant/amd64-base-python:3.14-alpine3.20" -t local/entity_manager .

# Run locally for testing
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 \
  -e HA_URL="http://your-ha-instance:8123" \
  -e HA_TOKEN="your-long-lived-token" \
  -e DIRECT_ACCESS_MODE="trusted" \
  local/entity_manager
```

Open `http://<development-computer>:5000` from another machine on the LAN. Use
`DIRECT_ACCESS_MODE=token` instead if the network is not fully trusted.

### Running Python tests on Windows

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

`pytest.ini` keeps temporary test data inside the repository, avoiding Windows
temp-directory permission differences between terminals and sandboxed tools.
