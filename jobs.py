"""Generic background-job infrastructure for long-running operations.

Long-running registry operations (renaming a device with many entities, batch
restructuring, device swaps) used to run synchronously inside the Flask request.
For large devices that exceeds the Ingress/proxy timeout: the client sees an
error toast while the work silently keeps running to completion with no visible
progress.

This module provides a small, Flask-agnostic building block to run such work as
a tracked background job instead:

* :class:`JobStore` persists jobs as atomic JSON files (like ``SwapJobStore``).
* :func:`new_job` creates the canonical job dict.
* :class:`JobContext` is handed to a job handler so it can report progress and
  log lines that get persisted (throttled) as the job runs.
* :class:`JobWorker` is a single, long-lived worker thread that runs queued jobs
  serially on one asyncio loop, off the request path, so registry-mutating work
  never overlaps and enqueue/poll requests stay fast.

The module knows nothing about Flask, Home Assistant or the concrete handlers;
those are injected. ``device_swap.SwapJobStore`` is a thin subclass of
:class:`JobStore`.
